# MDC-Vue
Material Design UI components for Vue.js

## Project IDLE
Well, i created this project because i want to create a material design component library for vue.js, three years ago.

But i am not using vue.js any more, or at least i do not want to create an library for it.

So, if you want to get the name for a better usage, please contact me with email(you can get that at my github page).

Please make sure your project which want to use `mdc-vue` has enough components, full documents, guides and users, and will maintain it in the future some years.
